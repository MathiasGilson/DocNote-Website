            </table>
          </div>

          <p>We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Services feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

          <h3>How is your personal data collected?</h3>
          <p>Most of the personal data that we process about you will be provided by you, for example when entering a Contract for the use of our Services. The provision of such information is voluntary, but if you cannot provide it to us, you may not be able to work with DocNote. Each time you use the Services we will automatically collect personal data including Technical Data and Usage Data. We collect this data using cookies and other similar technologies. Please see our cookie policy at Part B below for further details.</p>

          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>We use cookies and/or other tracking technologies to distinguish you from other users of the Services and to remember your preferences. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use the Services and also allows us to improve the Services. For detailed information on the cookies we use, the purposes for which we use them and how you can exercise your choices regarding our use of your cookies, see our cookie policy at Part B below.</p>

          <h3>How we use your personal data</h3>
          <p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to do so. Most commonly we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Where you have consented before the processing.</strong> Consent means processing your personal data where you have signified your agreement by a statement or clear opt-in to processing for a specific purpose. Consent will only be valid if it is a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of what you want. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.</li>
            <li><strong>Where we need to perform a contract</strong> we are about to enter or have entered with you. Performance of contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</li>
            <li><strong>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests</strong> (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</li>
            <li><strong>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</strong> Comply with a legal obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The table below explains what we use (process) your personal information for (other than the special category of data) and our reasons for doing so.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Our service providers acting as our processors, including:
              <ul>

            <li>Regulators, local authorities and other public or regulatory authorities acting as processors or joint controllers who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We only allow our service providers to handle your personal information if we are satisfied, they take appropriate measures to protect your personal information. We also impose contractual obligations on service providers to ensure they can only use your personal information to provide services to us and to you and for no other reasons. We may disclose and exchange information with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>

          <h3>Data security</h3>
          <p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers in Switzerland. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are legally required to do so.</p>
          <p>By contracting with us or using our Services, you consent to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of your information in and to Switzerland.</p>

          <h3>Data retention</h3>
          <p>We retain your personal data for as long as we need it for the purposes, we have collected it for, such as contracting with you for your use of our Services. We may retain your personal data for a longer period if you make a complaint under this privacy policy or our Terms of service, or if we have a reasonable belief that litigation may arise in relation to our relationship with you. We may also be required to retain certain personal data from you to comply with our legal and regulatory requirements. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights section below for further information. In some circumstances, we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

          <h3>Your legal rights</h3>
          <p>Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to be informed.</strong> You have the right to be informed how your personal data will be used. This privacy policy as well as any additional information or notice that is provided to you either at the time you provided your details, or otherwise, is intended to provide you with this information.</li>
            <li><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
            <li><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
              <ul>
                <li>if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
                <li>where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
                <li>where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
                <li>you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please contact us (<a href="mailto:contact@docnote.ch">contact@docnote.ch</a>) and:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>let us have enough information to identify you;</li>
            <li>let us have proof of your identity and address (a copy of your driving licence or passport and a recent utility or credit card bill); and</li>
            <li>let us know what right you want to exercise and the information to which your request relates.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

          <h3>How to complain</h3>
          <p>If you are unhappy with the way in which we have handled your personal data, please get in touch with us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contact@docnote.ch">contact@docnote.ch</a>. You are also entitled to make a complaint to the respective judicial and executive body which may have jurisdiction over the case.</p>

          <h3>Changes to this privacy policy</h3>
          <p>We keep this privacy policy under regular review and may update it from time to time without notice to you, so please check it regularly. We will however aim to bring any significant changes to your attention.</p>

          <h2>PART B - DOCNOTE COOKIES POLICY</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">Date of policy: 22nd of July 2025</p>

          <p>This cookies policy explains how DocNote uses cookies and other tracking technologies on the Services. This cookies policy is to be read alongside our privacy policy above which explains how we use personal information.</p>

          <h3>What are web cookies?</h3>
          <p>Web cookies are small files that are placed on your computer or mobile device by a website when you visit it. They contain details of your browsing history on that website and distinguish you from other users. Cookies send data back to the originating website on each subsequent visit or allow another website or app to recognize the cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website or app to recognize a user's device and, for instance, remember your preferences and generally improve your online user experience. Like most websites and apps, we use cookies.</p>
          <p>Although this cookies policy refers to the general term "cookie", which is the main method used by the Services to store information, the browser's local storage space is also used for the same purpose, and we may use other tracking technologies through the Services. As a result, the information included in this cookie policy is likewise applicable to all such tracking technologies that we use.</p>

          <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>To let you do things on the Services - for example, cookies enable you to log in to secure areas of our Services.</li>
            <li>To collect anonymous statistics - the information collected by cookies enables us to improve the Services through usage figures and patterns.</li>
            <li>To improve your experience of the Services - for example, to prevent you having to re-enter details when you have already done so, or by ensuring that users can find what they are looking for easily.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What cookies do we use?</h3>
          <p>We use the following cookies:</p>

          <p>Nous collectons, utilisons et partageons également des Données agrégées telles que des données statistiques ou démographiques à toute fin. Les Données agrégées peuvent être dérivées de vos données personnelles mais ne sont pas considérées comme des données personnelles en droit, car ces données ne révéleront pas directement ou indirectement votre identité. Par exemple, nous pouvons agréger vos Données d'utilisation pour calculer le pourcentage d'utilisateurs accédant à une fonctionnalité spécifique des Services. Toutefois, si nous combinons ou associons des Données agrégées avec vos données personnelles de manière à pouvoir vous identifier directement ou indirectement, nous traitons les données combinées comme des données personnelles qui seront utilisées conformément à la présente politique de confidentialité.</p>

          <h3>Comment vos données personnelles sont-elles collectées ?</h3>
          <p>La plupart des données personnelles que nous traitons à votre sujet vous seront demandées directement, par exemple lors de la conclusion d'un Contrat pour l'utilisation de nos Services. La fourniture de ces informations est volontaire, mais si vous ne pouvez pas nous les fournir, vous pourriez ne pas être en mesure de travailler avec DocNote. Chaque fois que vous utilisez les Services, nous collecterons automatiquement des données personnelles, y compris des Données techniques et des Données d'utilisation. Nous collectons ces données à l'aide de cookies et d'autres technologies similaires. Veuillez consulter notre politique en matière de cookies dans la Partie B ci-dessous pour plus de détails.</p>

          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>Nous utilisons des cookies et/ou d'autres technologies de suivi pour vous distinguer des autres utilisateurs des Services et pour mémoriser vos préférences. Cela nous aide à vous offrir une bonne expérience lorsque vous utilisez les Services et nous permet également d'améliorer les Services. Pour des informations détaillées sur les cookies que nous utilisons, les finalités pour lesquelles nous les utilisons et la manière dont vous pouvez exercer vos choix concernant notre utilisation de vos cookies, consultez notre politique en matière de cookies dans la Partie B ci-dessous.</p>

          <h3>Comment nous utilisons vos données personnelles</h3>
          <p>Nous n'utiliserons vos données personnelles que lorsque la loi nous le permet. Le plus souvent, nous utiliserons vos données personnelles dans les circonstances suivantes :</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lorsque vous avez consenti avant le traitement.</strong> Le consentement signifie le traitement de vos données personnelles lorsque vous avez manifesté votre accord par une déclaration ou une acceptation claire pour un traitement à une finalité spécifique. Le consentement n'est valable que s'il constitue une indication libre, spécifique, éclairée et sans ambiguïté de votre volonté. Vous pouvez retirer votre consentement à tout moment en nous contactant.</li>
            <li><strong>Lorsque nous devons exécuter un contrat</strong> que nous sommes sur le point de conclure ou avons conclu avec vous. L'exécution du contrat signifie le traitement de vos données lorsque cela est nécessaire pour l'exécution d'un contrat auquel vous êtes partie ou pour prendre des mesures à votre demande avant la conclusion d'un tel contrat.</li>
            <li><strong>Lorsque cela est nécessaire pour nos intérêts légitimes</strong> (ou ceux d'un tiers) et que vos intérêts et droits fondamentaux ne prévalent pas sur ces intérêts. L'Intérêt légitime désigne l'intérêt de notre entreprise à conduire et gérer nos activités afin de vous offrir le meilleur service/produit et l'expérience la plus sûre. Nous veillons à prendre en compte et à équilibrer tout impact potentiel sur vous (positif et négatif) et vos droits avant de traiter vos données personnelles pour nos intérêts légitimes. Nous n'utilisons pas vos données personnelles pour des activités où nos intérêts sont supplantés par l'impact sur vous (sauf si nous avons votre consentement ou si la loi nous y oblige ou nous le permet). Vous pouvez obtenir de plus amples informations sur la manière dont nous évaluons nos intérêts légitimes par rapport à tout impact potentiel sur vous pour des activités spécifiques en nous contactant.</li>
            <li><strong>Lorsque nous devons nous conformer à une obligation légale ou réglementaire.</strong> Se conformer à une obligation légale signifie traiter vos données personnelles lorsque cela est nécessaire pour le respect d'une obligation légale à laquelle nous sommes soumis.</li>

Nous imposons également des obligations contractuelles aux prestataires de services pour garantir qu'ils ne peuvent utiliser vos informations personnelles que pour nous fournir des services, à nous et à vous, et pour aucune autre raison. Nous pouvons divulguer et échanger des informations avec les forces de l'ordre et les organismes de réglementation pour nous conformer à nos obligations légales et réglementaires.</p>

          <h3>Conservation des données</h3>

Il peut également nous être demandé de conserver certaines données personnelles vous concernant pour nous conformer à nos exigences légales et réglementaires. Dans certaines circonstances, vous pouvez nous demander de supprimer vos données : consultez la section relative à vos droits légaux ci-dessous pour plus d'informations. Dans certaines circonstances, nous anonymiserons vos données personnelles (de sorte qu'elles ne puissent plus être associées à vous) à des fins de recherche ou de statistiques, auquel cas nous pourrons utiliser ces informations indéfiniment sans autre avis.</p>

            <li><strong>Demander l'effacement</strong> de vos données personnelles. Cela vous permet de nous demander de supprimer ou de retirer des données personnelles lorsqu'il n'y a aucune raison valable pour que nous continuions à les traiter. Vous avez également le droit de nous demander de supprimer ou de retirer vos données personnelles lorsque vous avez exercé avec succès votre droit d'opposition au traitement (voir ci-dessous), lorsque nous avons pu traiter vos informations de manière illicite ou lorsque nous sommes tenus d'effacer vos données personnelles pour nous conformer au droit local. Notez cependant que nous ne serons pas toujours en mesure de donner suite à votre demande d'effacement pour des raisons juridiques spécifiques qui vous seront notifiées, le cas échéant, au moment de votre demande.</li>
            <li><strong>S'opposer au traitement</strong> de vos données personnelles lorsque nous nous appuyons sur un intérêt légitime (ou celui d'un tiers) et qu'il y a quelque chose dans votre situation particulière qui vous amène à vous opposer au traitement sur ce fondement car vous estimez qu'il porte atteinte à vos droits et libertés fondamentaux. Vous avez également le droit de vous opposer lorsque nous traitons vos données personnelles à des fins de prospection commerciale.

                <li>lorsque notre utilisation des données est illicite mais que vous ne souhaitez pas que nous les effacions ;</li>
                <li>lorsque vous avez besoin que nous conservions les données même si nous n'en avons plus besoin, car vous en avez besoin pour établir, exercer ou défendre des droits en justice ; ou</li>
                <li>vous vous êtes opposé(e) à notre utilisation de vos données mais nous devons vérifier si nous avons des motifs légitimes prépondérants pour les utiliser.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Demander le transfert</strong> de vos données personnelles à vous ou à un tiers. Nous vous fournirons, ou au tiers que vous avez choisi, vos données personnelles dans un format structuré, couramment utilisé et lisible par machine. Notez que ce droit ne s'applique qu'aux informations automatisées pour lesquelles vous avez initialement donné votre consentement à notre utilisation ou lorsque nous avons utilisé les informations pour exécuter un contrat avec vous.</li>
            <li><strong>Retirer votre consentement à tout moment</strong> lorsque nous nous appuyons sur le consentement pour traiter vos données personnelles. Toutefois, cela n'affectera pas la licéité de tout traitement effectué avant que vous ne retiriez votre consentement. Si vous retirez votre consentement, nous pourrions ne pas être en mesure de vous fournir certains produits ou services. Nous vous en informerons le cas échéant au moment du retrait de votre consentement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Si vous souhaitez exercer l'un de ces droits, veuillez nous contacter (<a href="mailto:contact@docnote.ch">contact@docnote.ch</a>) et :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>nous fournir suffisamment d'informations pour vous identifier ;</li>
            <li>nous fournir une preuve de votre identité et de votre adresse (une copie de votre permis de conduire ou de votre passeport et une facture récente de services publics ou de carte de crédit) ; et</li>
            <li>nous indiquer le droit que vous souhaitez exercer et les informations auxquelles se rapporte votre demande.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Nous nous efforçons de répondre à toutes les demandes légitimes dans un délai d'un mois.

Dans ce cas, nous vous en informerons et vous tiendrons au courant.</p>

          <h3>Comment formuler une réclamation</h3>
          <p>Si vous n'êtes pas satisfait(e) de la manière dont nous avons traité vos données personnelles, veuillez nous contacter en envoyant un e-mail à <a href="mailto:contact@docnote.ch">contact@docnote.ch</a>.

          <p>Wir erheben, verwenden und teilen auch aggregierte Daten wie statistische oder demografische Daten für beliebige Zwecke. Aggregierte Daten können aus Ihren personenbezogenen Daten abgeleitet werden, gelten jedoch rechtlich nicht als personenbezogene Daten, da diese Daten Ihre Identität weder direkt noch indirekt offenbaren. Beispielsweise können wir Ihre Nutzungsdaten aggregieren, um den Prozentsatz der Nutzer zu berechnen, die auf eine bestimmte Funktion der Dienste zugreifen. Wenn wir jedoch aggregierte Daten mit Ihren personenbezogenen Daten kombinieren oder verknüpfen, sodass sie Sie direkt oder indirekt identifizieren können, behandeln wir die kombinierten Daten als personenbezogene Daten, die gemäss dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie verwendet werden.</p>

          <h3>Wie werden Ihre personenbezogenen Daten erhoben?</h3>
          <p>Die meisten personenbezogenen Daten, die wir über Sie verarbeiten, werden von Ihnen bereitgestellt, beispielsweise beim Abschluss eines Vertrags über die Nutzung unserer Dienste. Die Bereitstellung dieser Informationen ist freiwillig. Wenn Sie sie uns jedoch nicht zur Verfügung stellen können, sind Sie möglicherweise nicht in der Lage, mit DocNote zusammenzuarbeiten. Jedes Mal, wenn Sie die Dienste nutzen, erheben wir automatisch personenbezogene Daten, einschliesslich technischer Daten und Nutzungsdaten. Wir erheben diese Daten mithilfe von Cookies und anderen ähnlichen Technologien. Bitte beachten Sie unsere Cookie-Richtlinie in Teil B unten für weitere Einzelheiten.</p>

          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <p>Wir verwenden Cookies und/oder andere Tracking-Technologien, um Sie von anderen Nutzern der Dienste zu unterscheiden und Ihre Präferenzen zu speichern. Dies hilft uns, Ihnen ein gutes Erlebnis bei der Nutzung der Dienste zu bieten, und ermöglicht es uns auch, die Dienste zu verbessern. Ausführliche Informationen über die von uns verwendeten Cookies, die Zwecke, für die wir sie verwenden, und wie Sie Ihre Wahlmöglichkeiten bezüglich unserer Verwendung Ihrer Cookies ausüben können, finden Sie in unserer Cookie-Richtlinie in Teil B unten.</p>

          <h3>Wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verwenden</h3>
          <p>Wir verwenden Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nur, wenn das Gesetz es uns erlaubt. Am häufigsten verwenden wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten unter folgenden Umständen:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wenn Sie vor der Verarbeitung eingewilligt haben.</strong> Einwilligung bedeutet die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten, wenn Sie Ihre Zustimmung durch eine Erklärung oder eine eindeutige Opt-in-Handlung für einen bestimmten Zweck signalisiert haben. Die Einwilligung ist nur gültig, wenn sie eine freiwillige, spezifische, informierte und unmissverständliche Willensbekundung darstellt. Sie können Ihre Einwilligung jederzeit widerrufen, indem Sie uns kontaktieren.</li>
            <li><strong>Wenn wir einen Vertrag erfüllen müssen</strong>, den wir mit Ihnen abschliessen werden oder abgeschlossen haben. Vertragserfüllung bedeutet die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten, wenn dies für die Erfüllung eines Vertrags, dessen Vertragspartei Sie sind, erforderlich ist oder um auf Ihren Wunsch hin vor Abschluss eines solchen Vertrags Massnahmen zu ergreifen.</li>
            <li><strong>Wenn es für unsere berechtigten Interessen erforderlich ist</strong> (oder die eines Dritten) und Ihre Interessen und Grundrechte diese Interessen nicht überwiegen. Berechtigtes Interesse bezeichnet das Interesse unseres Unternehmens an der Führung und Verwaltung unserer Geschäftstätigkeit, um Ihnen den besten Service/das beste Produkt und das sicherste Erlebnis zu bieten. Wir stellen sicher, dass wir alle potenziellen Auswirkungen auf Sie (sowohl positive als auch negative) und Ihre Rechte abwägen, bevor wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für unsere berechtigten Interessen verarbeiten. Wir verwenden Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht für Aktivitäten, bei denen unsere Interessen durch die Auswirkungen auf Sie überwiegen werden (es sei denn, wir haben Ihre Einwilligung oder sind anderweitig gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet oder berechtigt). Sie können weitere Informationen darüber, wie wir unsere berechtigten Interessen gegen mögliche Auswirkungen auf Sie bei bestimmten Aktivitäten abwägen, erhalten, indem Sie uns kontaktieren.</li>
            <li><strong>Wenn wir einer gesetzlichen oder regulatorischen Verpflichtung nachkommen müssen.</strong> Die Einhaltung einer gesetzlichen Verpflichtung bedeutet die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten, wenn dies für die Erfüllung einer gesetzlichen Verpflichtung erforderlich ist, der wir unterliegen.</li>

          <p>Wir gestatten unseren Dienstleistern nur dann den Umgang mit Ihren personenbezogenen Daten, wenn wir davon überzeugt sind, dass sie angemessene Massnahmen zum Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten ergreifen. Wir erlegen Dienstleistern auch vertragliche Verpflichtungen auf, um sicherzustellen, dass sie Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nur zur Erbringung von Dienstleistungen für uns und für Sie verwenden können und für keine anderen Zwecke. Wir können Informationen an Strafverfolgungsbehörden und Regulierungsbehörden weitergeben und mit diesen austauschen, um unseren gesetzlichen und regulatorischen Verpflichtungen nachzukommen.</p>

          <h3>Datensicherheit</h3>
          <p>Alle Informationen, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen, werden auf unseren sicheren Servern in der Schweiz gespeichert. Sobald wir Ihre Informationen erhalten haben, werden wir strenge Verfahren und Sicherheitsfunktionen anwenden, um zu verhindern, dass Ihre personenbezogenen Daten versehentlich verloren gehen, verwendet oder auf unbefugte Weise abgerufen werden. Wir haben Verfahren eingerichtet, um mit jedem vermuteten Verstoss gegen den Schutz personenbezogener Daten umzugehen, und werden Sie und die zuständige Aufsichtsbehörde benachrichtigen, wenn wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet sind.</p>
          <p>Durch den Vertragsabschluss mit uns oder die Nutzung unserer Dienste stimmen Sie der Erhebung, Speicherung, Verarbeitung und Übermittlung Ihrer Daten in die und innerhalb der Schweiz zu.</p>

          <h3>Datenspeicherung</h3>
          <p>Wir bewahren Ihre personenbezogenen Daten so lange auf, wie wir sie für die Zwecke benötigen, für die wir sie erhoben haben, z. B. für den Vertragsabschluss mit Ihnen über die Nutzung unserer Dienste. Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für einen längeren Zeitraum aufbewahren, wenn Sie eine Beschwerde im Rahmen dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie oder unserer Nutzungsbedingungen einreichen oder wenn wir vernünftigerweise davon ausgehen, dass im Zusammenhang mit unserer Geschäftsbeziehung mit Ihnen ein Rechtsstreit entstehen könnte. Es kann auch erforderlich sein, dass wir bestimmte personenbezogene Daten von Ihnen aufbewahren, um unseren gesetzlichen und regulatorischen Anforderungen nachzukommen. Unter bestimmten Umständen können Sie uns auffordern, Ihre Daten zu löschen: Weitere Informationen finden Sie im Abschnitt über Ihre gesetzlichen Rechte weiter unten. Unter bestimmten Umständen werden wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten anonymisieren (sodass sie nicht mehr mit Ihnen in Verbindung gebracht werden können), zu Forschungs- oder statistischen Zwecken. In diesem Fall können wir diese Informationen ohne weitere Benachrichtigung an Sie auf unbestimmte Zeit verwenden.</p>

          <h3>Ihre gesetzlichen Rechte</h3>
          <p>Unter bestimmten Umständen haben Sie im Rahmen der Datenschutzgesetze die folgenden Rechte in Bezug auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Auskunft über Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verlangen</strong> (allgemein als „Betroffenenauskunft" bekannt). Dies ermöglicht es Ihnen, eine Kopie der personenbezogenen Daten zu erhalten, die wir über Sie gespeichert haben, und zu überprüfen, ob wir sie rechtmässig verarbeiten.</li>
            <li><strong>Recht auf Information.</strong> Sie haben das Recht, darüber informiert zu werden, wie Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verwendet werden. Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie sowie alle zusätzlichen Informationen oder Hinweise, die Ihnen entweder zum Zeitpunkt der Angabe Ihrer Daten oder anderweitig zur Verfügung gestellt werden, sollen Ihnen diese Informationen bereitstellen.</li>
            <li><strong>Berichtigung verlangen</strong> der personenbezogenen Daten, die wir über Sie gespeichert haben. Dies ermöglicht es Ihnen, unvollständige oder ungenaue Daten, die wir über Sie gespeichert haben, korrigieren zu lassen, obwohl wir die Richtigkeit der neuen Daten, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen, möglicherweise überprüfen müssen.</li>
            <li><strong>Löschung verlangen</strong> Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten. Dies ermöglicht es Ihnen, uns aufzufordern, personenbezogene Daten zu löschen oder zu entfernen, wenn kein triftiger Grund für deren weitere Verarbeitung durch uns besteht. Sie haben auch das Recht, uns aufzufordern, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu löschen oder zu entfernen, wenn Sie Ihr Widerspruchsrecht erfolgreich ausgeübt haben (siehe unten), wenn wir Ihre Daten möglicherweise unrechtmässig verarbeitet haben oder wenn wir verpflichtet sind, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zur Einhaltung des lokalen Rechts zu löschen. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass wir Ihrer Löschungsanfrage aus bestimmten rechtlichen Gründen möglicherweise nicht immer nachkommen können, die Ihnen gegebenenfalls zum Zeitpunkt Ihrer Anfrage mitgeteilt werden.</li>
            <li><strong>Der Verarbeitung widersprechen</strong> Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten, wenn wir uns auf ein berechtigtes Interesse (oder das eines Dritten) stützen und es etwas in Ihrer besonderen Situation gibt, das Sie dazu veranlasst, der Verarbeitung auf dieser Grundlage zu widersprechen, da Sie der Meinung sind, dass dies Ihre Grundrechte und -freiheiten beeinträchtigt. Sie haben auch das Recht, Widerspruch einzulegen, wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten für Direktmarketingzwecke verarbeiten. In einigen Fällen können wir nachweisen, dass wir zwingende berechtigte Gründe für die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten haben, die Ihre Rechte und Freiheiten überwiegen.</li>
            <li><strong>Einschränkung der Verarbeitung verlangen</strong> Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten. Dies ermöglicht es Ihnen, uns aufzufordern, die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten in den folgenden Fällen auszusetzen:
              <ul>
                <li>wenn Sie möchten, dass wir die Richtigkeit der Daten feststellen;</li>
                <li>wenn unsere Nutzung der Daten unrechtmässig ist, Sie aber nicht möchten, dass wir sie löschen;</li>
                <li>wenn Sie die Daten benötigen, auch wenn wir sie nicht mehr benötigen, da Sie sie zur Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen benötigen; oder</li>
                <li>Sie der Nutzung Ihrer Daten durch uns widersprochen haben, wir aber überprüfen müssen, ob wir überwiegende berechtigte Gründe für deren Nutzung haben.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Übertragung verlangen</strong> Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten an Sie oder an einen Dritten. Wir stellen Ihnen oder einem von Ihnen gewählten Dritten Ihre personenbezogenen Daten in einem strukturierten, gängigen, maschinenlesbaren Format zur Verfügung. Beachten Sie, dass dieses Recht nur für automatisierte Informationen gilt, für die Sie ursprünglich Ihre Einwilligung zur Nutzung gegeben haben oder bei denen wir die Informationen zur Vertragserfüllung mit Ihnen verwendet haben.</li>
            <li><strong>Einwilligung jederzeit widerrufen</strong>, wenn wir uns auf die Einwilligung zur Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten stützen. Dies berührt jedoch nicht die Rechtmässigkeit der Verarbeitung, die vor dem Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung durchgeführt wurde. Wenn Sie Ihre Einwilligung widerrufen, sind wir möglicherweise nicht in der Lage, Ihnen bestimmte Produkte oder Dienstleistungen bereitzustellen. Wir werden Sie darüber informieren, falls dies zum Zeitpunkt des Widerrufs Ihrer Einwilligung der Fall ist.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Wenn Sie eines dieser Rechte ausüben möchten, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte (<a href="mailto:contact@docnote.ch">contact@docnote.ch</a>) und:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>geben Sie uns genügend Informationen, um Sie zu identifizieren;</li>
            <li>legen Sie uns einen Nachweis Ihrer Identität und Adresse vor (eine Kopie Ihres Führerscheins oder Reisepasses und eine aktuelle Versorgungs- oder Kreditkartenabrechnung); und</li>
            <li>teilen Sie uns mit, welches Recht Sie ausüben möchten und auf welche Informationen sich Ihre Anfrage bezieht.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Wir bemühen uns, alle berechtigten Anfragen innerhalb eines Monats zu beantworten. Gelegentlich kann es länger als einen Monat dauern, wenn Ihre Anfrage besonders komplex ist oder Sie mehrere Anfragen gestellt haben. In diesem Fall werden wir Sie benachrichtigen und auf dem Laufenden halten.</p>

          <h3>Wie Sie eine Beschwerde einreichen</h3>
          <p>Wenn Sie mit der Art und Weise, wie wir mit Ihren personenbezogenen Daten umgegangen sind, unzufrieden sind, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte per E-Mail an <a href="mailto:contact@docnote.ch">contact@docnote.ch</a>. Sie sind auch berechtigt, eine Beschwerde bei der zuständigen Justiz- und Vollzugsbehörde einzureichen, die möglicherweise für den Fall zuständig ist.</p>
