# DocNote Exhibits at CHU HealthTech ConnexionDay in Bordeaux

**BORDEAUX** — The CHU HealthTech ConnexionDay in December 2025 brought healthcare technology vendors face-to-face with decision-makers from France's university hospital centers. Among the exhibitors was DocNote, a Swiss AI medical documentation platform making its first significant push into the French healthcare market.

The one-day event in Bordeaux illustrated both the opportunities and complexities facing healthcare technology companies attempting to cross borders within Europe. While medical challenges may be universal, healthcare systems remain stubbornly national—with distinct procurement processes, reimbursement structures, and regulatory requirements that can frustrate companies seeking regional expansion.

## The French Hospital Market

France's CHU system—centres hospitaliers universitaires or university hospital centers—represents some of the most influential healthcare institutions in French medicine. These large teaching hospitals shape medical practice standards, train future physicians, and often serve as early adopters of healthcare innovations.

However, French public hospitals operate under budget constraints and bureaucratic procurement processes quite different from Switzerland's more decentralized, insurance-based healthcare system. What DocNote has learned selling to Swiss private practices may not directly transfer to navigating French hospital administration.

Several CHU representatives who visited DocNote's exhibition stand expressed interest in the platform's capabilities while noting the lengthy evaluation and approval processes required for new software systems in French public hospitals.

## Language and Technology

DocNote's multilingual capabilities emerged as a selling point but also highlighted technical challenges. The platform supports French, but French medical terminology includes regional variations and specialty-specific jargon that AI systems can struggle to capture accurately.

"The technology works quite well for straightforward consultations," commented a physician from CHU de Bordeaux who tested the system. "But medical French can be quite particular, especially in specialized departments. The AI sometimes misses nuances."

These observations reflect broader challenges in natural language processing: what works well in one linguistic context may require substantial refinement for another, even within the same language.

## Data Sovereignty Concerns

French healthcare institutions, like their European counterparts, place significant emphasis on data protection and sovereignty. Multiple conversations at the DocNote booth focused on where patient data would be processed and stored.

The company's Swiss hosting—positioned as an advantage given Switzerland's strong data protection reputation—also raised questions. Some French administrators wondered whether hosting patient data outside France might conflict with national data sovereignty preferences, even as they acknowledged Switzerland's robust privacy framework.

These discussions reflected broader European tensions around data flows and digital sovereignty that extend well beyond healthcare into areas like cloud computing and digital services.

## Competitive Landscape

The Bordeaux event revealed that DocNote faces competition not just from other AI documentation startups but from established electronic health record vendors adding AI capabilities to existing systems. Several French hospitals already use comprehensive EHR platforms, and adding AI documentation features to these familiar systems might prove easier than adopting standalone tools.

One hospital IT director noted: "Integration is always our biggest challenge. If we can get 80% of what a specialized tool offers but within our existing system, that's often more practical than implementing something new."

This perspective suggests DocNote's path in France may depend significantly on developing partnerships with existing hospital IT infrastructure providers rather than pursuing direct sales.

## Market Development Strategy

For DocNote, the Bordeaux exhibition represented an exploratory step rather than an imminent market entry. The company remains primarily focused on Switzerland, with French expansion more aspirational than immediate.

Company representatives described conversations at the event as "relationship building" and "market research"—learning about French healthcare needs and procurement processes rather than actively selling. This cautious approach reflects practical constraints: a small company with limited resources must prioritize markets carefully.

## Cultural Differences

Beyond technical and regulatory considerations, cultural differences in medical practice emerged as a factor. French physicians often have different documentation norms than their Swiss counterparts, shaped by distinct medical education systems and practice patterns.

Several French physicians noted that their documentation style tends toward more narrative notes compared to the structured formats common in Swiss practice. Whether DocNote's AI, trained primarily on Swiss medical consultations, would adapt well to French documentation preferences remained an open question.

## Practical Next Steps

Despite challenges, the Bordeaux event generated leads that DocNote will presumably pursue in 2026. Several CHUs expressed interest in pilot programs, though converting interest into actual implementations typically requires months of additional conversations, demonstrations, and negotiations.

For French hospitals, implementing new documentation systems involves coordination across multiple departments: IT, medical staff, administration, and legal. Each constituency has distinct concerns that must be addressed before procurement decisions are made.

## Broader European Ambitions

DocNote's presence in Bordeaux signals ambitions beyond its Swiss home market, but expanding across Europe remains challenging for healthcare technology companies. The European Union may function as a single market for many goods and services, but healthcare largely remains organized at national levels.

Companies like DocNote must decide whether to pursue gradual, country-by-country expansion—adapting their products to each market's specific requirements—or wait until they achieve sufficient scale and resources to tackle multiple markets simultaneously.

## Market Reality

The CHU HealthTech ConnexionDay provided DocNote with valuable exposure to French healthcare decision-makers and insights into market requirements. However, converting conference conversations into actual French hospital customers will likely prove considerably more difficult than simply exhibiting at an event.

Healthcare technology sales cycles are notoriously long, particularly in public hospital systems. Even if everything proceeds smoothly, DocNote might not see actual French implementations until late 2026 or beyond.

For now, the Bordeaux exhibition represents a signal of ambition—DocNote positioning itself for potential European expansion while the hard work of actually achieving it remains ahead.
