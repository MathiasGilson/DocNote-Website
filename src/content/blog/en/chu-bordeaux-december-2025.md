# DocNote Exhibits at CHU HealthTech ConnexionDay in Bordeaux

In December 2025, DocNote participated in the CHU HealthTech ConnexionDay in Bordeaux, France, a premier event connecting healthcare technology innovators with hospital administrators, clinicians, and digital health decision-makers. This strategic conference brings together university hospitals (CHUs) from across France to explore cutting-edge health technologies and foster innovation partnerships.

## The CHU HealthTech ConnexionDay

The CHU HealthTech ConnexionDay has become an essential gathering for French healthcare innovation. Organized to facilitate direct connections between technology providers and major teaching hospitals, the event provides a unique opportunity for meaningful discussions about real-world healthcare challenges and technological solutions.

## DocNote's Exhibition Stand

Our team operated a dedicated exhibition stand throughout the day-long event, providing personalized demonstrations of DocNote's AI-powered medical documentation platform. The stand attracted steady interest from hospital administrators, department heads, and physicians curious about how AI can address the documentation burden facing French healthcare.

## Cross-Border Healthcare Innovation

While DocNote is based in Switzerland, the Bordeaux conference highlighted the shared challenges facing healthcare systems throughout Europe. French physicians and their Swiss counterparts face remarkably similar documentation burdens, regulatory requirements, and workflow pressures.

## Key Discussions

Throughout the day, our conversations with CHU representatives centered on several important themes:

### Hospital-Wide Implementation
Several teaching hospitals expressed interest in institution-wide deployment of AI documentation tools. Discussions addressed integration with existing EMR systems, training protocols, and change management strategies.

### Department-Specific Needs
Different medical departments have unique documentation requirements. We explored how DocNote can be customized for various specialties, from emergency medicine's rapid documentation needs to surgery's detailed operative notes.

### French Language Support
French healthcare professionals emphasized the importance of AI systems that work seamlessly in French. DocNote's multilingual capabilities, including strong French language support, generated significant interest.

### Data Sovereignty and Security
French healthcare institutions place particular emphasis on data sovereignty and GDPR compliance. Our detailed discussions of DocNote's security architecture and Swiss data hosting reassured hospital leaders about data protection.

## Strategic Partnerships

The ConnexionDay format, which emphasizes meaningful conversations over brief interactions, allowed us to develop several promising relationships with French healthcare institutions. These connections may lead to pilot programs and collaborative development initiatives in the coming months.

## Regional Healthcare Ecosystem

Bordeaux, home to one of France's leading university hospital centers, has developed a vibrant healthcare innovation ecosystem. The conference provided valuable insights into the French approach to healthcare digitalization and the specific challenges facing French teaching hospitals as they navigate digital transformation.

## Feedback and Insights

The direct feedback from French healthcare professionals proved invaluable:
- Strong interest in reducing administrative time to allow more patient contact
- Emphasis on ease of use and minimal learning curve for new technologies
- Desire for solutions that integrate with existing workflows rather than requiring workflow redesign
- Appreciation for technology developed by practicing physicians who understand clinical realities

## Looking Ahead

The CHU HealthTech ConnexionDay in Bordeaux marks an important step in DocNote's engagement with the broader European healthcare community. While we remain firmly rooted in Swiss healthcare, the universal challenges of medical documentation create opportunities to support physicians beyond Switzerland's borders.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our sincere thanks to the organizers of the CHU HealthTech ConnexionDay for creating such a valuable forum for healthcare innovation. We are grateful to all the CHU representatives, physicians, and administrators who visited our stand and shared their experiences and needs.

The conversations in Bordeaux remind us that healthcare professionals everywhere share the same dedication to patient care and the same frustration with administrative burdens. DocNote is committed to supporting this community across borders, languages, and healthcare systems.

As we close out 2025, we are energized by these connections and excited about the opportunities to serve more healthcare professionals in the year ahead.
