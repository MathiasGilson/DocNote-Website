# DocNote at Adopt AI Paris: Europe's Leading AI Healthcare Summit

In November 2025, DocNote participated in Adopt AI, one of Europe's most significant conferences dedicated to artificial intelligence in healthcare. Held in Paris, this landmark event brought together thousands of healthcare professionals, AI innovators, policymakers, and technology leaders to explore the future of AI in medicine.

## A Global Stage for Healthcare AI

Adopt AI has established itself as the premier European forum for discussing the practical implementation of AI in healthcare settings. The conference featured over 100 speakers, including leading physicians, data scientists, hospital administrators, and AI researchers from across Europe and beyond.

## DocNote's Presence

Our team operated a dedicated exhibition booth throughout the three-day conference, providing live demonstrations of DocNote's AI transcription and documentation capabilities. The response from attendees was remarkable, with healthcare professionals from France, Switzerland, Belgium, and throughout Europe stopping by to learn how DocNote is transforming medical documentation.

## Key Conference Themes

The conference addressed several critical topics that align closely with DocNote's mission:

### AI Implementation in Clinical Practice
Discussions focused on moving AI from theory to practical, daily use in hospitals and clinics. DocNote's real-world deployment in Swiss healthcare facilities served as a concrete example of successful AI implementation.

### Regulatory Compliance and Data Protection
European healthcare AI faces stringent regulatory requirements, particularly under GDPR and medical device regulations. Our presentations emphasized DocNote's commitment to Swiss and European data protection standards.

### Physician Burnout and AI Solutions
Multiple panels addressed how administrative burden contributes to physician burnout. DocNote's ability to reduce documentation time resonated strongly with conference attendees concerned about physician wellbeing.

## Notable Connections

The conference facilitated valuable connections with:
- Hospital innovation officers exploring AI adoption strategies
- Medical associations interested in supporting their members with AI tools
- Healthcare technology partners for potential integrations
- Research institutions studying AI's impact on clinical workflows

## International Interest

While DocNote is rooted in Swiss healthcare, the Adopt AI conference revealed significant international interest in our platform. Healthcare professionals from multiple European countries inquired about DocNote's availability in their regions, highlighting the universal nature of documentation challenges in modern medicine.

## Looking to the Future

Adopt AI Paris reinforced our understanding that the challenges DocNote addresses are not unique to Switzerland but are felt throughout European healthcare. The conference energized our team and provided valuable insights into how we can continue to evolve our platform to serve the broader European medical community.

## Gratitude

We thank the Adopt AI organizing committee for creating such a valuable forum for healthcare AI innovation and all the conference attendees who visited our booth and shared their experiences and needs. These conversations directly inform our ongoing development efforts.

The future of AI in healthcare is bright, and DocNote is proud to be part of this transformation alongside so many dedicated healthcare professionals and innovators.
