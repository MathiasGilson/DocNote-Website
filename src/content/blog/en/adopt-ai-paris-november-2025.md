# DocNote at Adopt AI Paris: Europe's Leading AI Healthcare Summit

**PARIS** — Thousands of healthcare professionals, technology developers, and policy makers converged on Paris in November 2025 for Adopt AI, one of Europe's largest conferences dedicated to artificial intelligence in healthcare. Among the exhibitors was DocNote, a Swiss medical documentation platform seeking to expand its presence beyond Switzerland's borders.

The three-day conference highlighted both the promise and challenges of implementing AI in European healthcare systems, with DocNote's exhibition booth serving as a microcosm of broader industry dynamics playing out across the continent.

## A Crowded Market

The conference floor revealed an increasingly competitive landscape for AI-powered healthcare documentation tools. Dozens of companies, ranging from well-funded startups to established electronic health record vendors adding AI features, demonstrated similar capabilities for converting medical conversations into structured notes.

DocNote differentiated itself primarily through its Swiss provenance and emphasis on data sovereignty—a positioning that resonated particularly with European healthcare administrators navigating GDPR compliance and national data protection laws.

"The Swiss angle is significant," observed a hospital innovation officer from Belgium who visited DocNote's booth. "There's inherent trust in Swiss data handling, which matters enormously in healthcare."

## Physician Burnout Takes Center Stage

Multiple conference panels addressed physician burnout, with administrative burden emerging as a consistent theme. Studies presented at the conference suggested that physicians in some European countries spend more than 50% of their clinical hours on documentation and administrative tasks rather than direct patient care.

This data provided favorable context for companies like DocNote pitching documentation efficiency. However, speakers also noted that AI adoption itself can initially increase cognitive load as physicians learn new systems, potentially offsetting short-term benefits.

## Regulatory Uncertainty

Behind-the-scenes discussions at the conference frequently turned to regulatory challenges. The European Union's evolving AI Act creates uncertainty about classification requirements for medical documentation tools. Some systems may qualify as medical devices requiring extensive regulatory approval, while others might fall into lower-risk categories.

DocNote representatives emphasized their current focus on the Swiss market, which operates outside EU regulatory frameworks while maintaining high standards. This approach allows the company to refine its technology before potentially tackling the complexities of EU medical device certification.

## International Expansion Questions

Conference attendance from across Europe sparked questions about DocNote's geographic strategy. The platform's multilingual capabilities—supporting French, German, and English—theoretically position it for expansion into multiple European markets.

However, healthcare is notably fragmented across Europe, with each country operating distinct reimbursement systems, electronic health record infrastructures, and medical practice patterns. What works in Swiss private practices may require substantial adaptation for public hospitals in France or Germany.

Several French hospital representatives expressed interest in pilot programs, though conversations suggested these remained preliminary rather than committal.

## The Physician-Founded Factor

DocNote consistently highlighted its physician founders, particularly Dr. Alice Gilson and Dr. Vincent Tan, as differentiators. This physician-led approach appeared to generate credibility, particularly among clinician attendees skeptical of technology companies lacking medical expertise.

"There's a fundamental difference between engineers building what they think doctors need versus doctors building what they know they need," commented one French emergency physician visiting the booth, though he acknowledged that physician involvement doesn't guarantee commercial success.

## Market Realities

While Adopt AI showcased significant enthusiasm for healthcare AI, the conference also exposed market realities. Multiple exhibitors mentioned challenges converting interest into contracts, as hospitals and medical practices often move slowly on technology adoption decisions.

For a company like DocNote, still establishing itself in its home Swiss market, the Paris conference represented brand building and relationship development rather than immediate business generation. The company's presence signaled ambitions for European expansion, even as the practical timeline for such growth remained uncertain.

## Looking Ahead

Adopt AI Paris illustrated both opportunities and obstacles for AI medical documentation platforms in Europe. The market demand appears substantial, driven by genuine physician frustration with administrative burdens. However, competition is intensifying, regulatory pathways remain unclear, and healthcare institutions remain cautious about adopting AI tools for core clinical functions.

DocNote's participation reflected a company at an inflection point—having established initial presence in Switzerland, now exploring whether and how to pursue broader European ambitions. The conversations initiated in Paris will likely influence strategic decisions in the coming year about market expansion, partnership development, and product evolution.

For European healthcare more broadly, conferences like Adopt AI suggest that AI documentation tools will become increasingly common, though the specific winners and implementation models remain to be determined.
