At the ADOPT AI Congress, an event focused on the real-world implementation of artificial intelligence across industries, DocNote joined hospital leaders, researchers and digital health innovators to discuss how AI can move from pilot projects to large-scale adoption.

The congress centered on practical challenges: data governance, regulatory compliance, cybersecurity, interoperability and measurable clinical impact. Beyond technological performance, discussions emphasized the importance of integration into existing hospital workflows and clinician acceptance.

During the event, DocNote presented its AI assistant designed to automate hospital documentation workflows. The solution generates structured clinical documents, including outpatient reports, inpatient ward notes, operative reports and discharge letters, from recorded clinical conversations and uploaded medical documents, with direct integration into electronic health record (EHR) systems.

Conversations highlighted a shared priority across institutions: reducing administrative burden while maintaining strict health data protection standards.
