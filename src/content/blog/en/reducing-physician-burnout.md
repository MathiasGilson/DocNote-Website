In Stud Health Technol Inform., researchers from Chi Mei Medical Center examined the impact of an AI-based documentation tool on nursing workflow and record quality. Their study "Enhancing Healthcare Efficiency: Integrating ChatGPT in Nursing Documentation" explored how a large language model (LLM)-driven solution could streamline routine documentation tasks.

The tool, dubbed "A+ Nurse," was introduced into the nursing documentation process with the explicit aim of reducing time spent writing care notes while maintaining or improving documentation standards. According to the reported findings, the integration of AI into the workflow led to a marked decrease in documentation time per patient, from approximately 15 minutes to around 5 minutes, without compromising the quality of records. Nurses using the system highlighted its intuitive design and noted that it helped them complete electronic records more efficiently.

These results point to the potential of generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT-based tools in alleviating one of the most persistent administrative burdens in clinical care: documentation. By automating portions of the note-writing process, such systems may allow healthcare professionals, particularly in high-volume settings like nursing, to reallocate time toward direct patient care and other clinical priorities.

While this study represents an early exploration of AI in nursing documentation, its findings contribute to a broader conversation about how artificial intelligence can be responsibly deployed to enhance efficiency and support clinician workflows in real-world practice.
