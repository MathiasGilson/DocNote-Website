# DocNote at Swiss College of Surgeons Congress in Lausanne

In May 2025, DocNote had the privilege of participating in the Swiss College of Surgeons (SCS) Annual Meeting, held at the prestigious École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). This landmark event brought together Switzerland's most accomplished surgeons and surgical residents to discuss innovations in surgical practice and patient care.

## Surgical Documentation Innovation

The surgical community faces unique documentation challenges, from detailed operative notes to complex post-operative care instructions. At the SCS Congress, we demonstrated how DocNote's AI technology can streamline these critical documentation tasks while maintaining the precision and detail that surgical practice demands.

## Meeting Switzerland's Surgical Leaders

The congress provided an invaluable opportunity to engage directly with surgical specialists across multiple disciplines. From general surgery to specialized surgical subspecialties, we received insightful feedback on how DocNote can be optimized for the unique workflows of surgical practice.

## Conference Highlights

- Presentation of DocNote's capabilities for operative note documentation
- Demonstrations of real-time transcription during simulated surgical consultations
- Discussions on integration with surgical scheduling and EMR systems
- Meetings with department heads from major Swiss hospitals

## The EPFL Experience

Hosting the congress at EPFL, one of Europe's leading technology institutes, created the perfect backdrop for discussions about the intersection of advanced technology and surgical excellence. The venue symbolized the bridge we're building between cutting-edge AI and traditional medical expertise.

## Surgical Community Feedback

Surgeons at the conference expressed particular interest in:
- Time-saving capabilities for post-operative documentation
- Integration with existing hospital systems
- Compliance with Swiss data protection requirements
- Customization options for different surgical specialties

## Next Steps

The connections made at the SCS Congress strengthen our commitment to serving the surgical community. The feedback we received will directly inform our product development, ensuring DocNote meets the exacting standards of surgical documentation.

We extend our gratitude to the Swiss College of Surgeons for welcoming DocNote to this important annual gathering and to all the surgeons who shared their valuable insights with our team.
