Citing recent Swiss data, she highlighted that physicians spend up to five hours per day on administrative tasks. She identified key causes: poorly designed EHR systems, increasing regulatory requirements, medico-legal traceability and complex clinical coding obligations.

While early studies show that AI-powered documentation tools can reduce note-writing time by around 20% and improve quality, Dr. Gilson stressed the associated risks, including hallucinations, clinical responsibility and data protection concerns under Swiss and EU law.

She concluded by presenting DocNote, a Swiss-developed solution designed to generate anonymised consultation reports while ensuring strict local data storage and automatic deletion of recordings, aiming to reduce administrative workload without compromising confidentiality.
