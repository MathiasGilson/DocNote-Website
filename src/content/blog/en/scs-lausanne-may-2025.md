# DocNote at Swiss College of Surgeons Congress in Lausanne

**LAUSANNE** — The Swiss College of Surgeons (SCS) welcomed DocNote, an AI-powered medical documentation platform, to its annual meeting in May 2025 at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). The event marked a notable intersection between Switzerland's surgical community and emerging artificial intelligence technologies designed to address administrative challenges in healthcare.

The congress, which brought together hundreds of surgeons and surgical residents from across Switzerland, provided a platform for DocNote to demonstrate how AI might address the time-consuming documentation requirements that have become a persistent concern in surgical practice.

## The Documentation Challenge in Surgery

Surgical documentation presents unique complexities compared to other medical specialties. Operative notes must capture intricate procedural details, patient-specific variations, and post-operative care instructions with precision. Traditional dictation and manual entry methods often consume significant time that surgeons could otherwise spend in clinical activities.

DocNote's presentation at the conference focused on how natural language processing could streamline this workflow while maintaining the detailed accuracy that surgical documentation demands. The company demonstrated real-time transcription capabilities during simulated surgical consultations, showing how the platform captures medical terminology and surgical procedures with reported accuracy rates exceeding 95%.

## Surgical Community Response

The response from attending surgeons reflected both interest and caution. Several department heads from major Swiss hospitals attended private demonstrations, asking detailed questions about integration with existing hospital information systems and electronic medical record platforms.

"The potential is clear, but implementation in a surgical environment requires careful consideration," commented one senior surgeon from a Zurich teaching hospital who requested anonymity. "Operative notes are legal documents. Any technology in this space needs to be absolutely reliable."

The EPFL venue itself seemed strategically chosen, symbolizing the convergence of technical innovation and medical practice. As one of Europe's leading engineering schools, EPFL has become a hub for healthcare technology development, making it a fitting location for discussions about AI in surgical care.

## Market Context

The Swiss surgical market represents a small but influential target for healthcare technology companies. Switzerland's reputation for medical excellence and its position as a hub for health technology innovation makes it an attractive proving ground for new medical software.

DocNote's approach of founding the company with practicing physicians—including Dr. Alice Gilson, a surgical specialist—appeared to lend credibility to their pitch. Multiple conference attendees mentioned this physician-led development as a differentiating factor compared to purely technology-focused companies.

## Integration Challenges Ahead

Discussion sessions revealed significant questions about practical implementation. Swiss hospitals operate on various electronic medical record systems, and ensuring seamless integration across these platforms remains a technical challenge. Additionally, Switzerland's multilingual medical environment—with German, French, and Italian spoken across different regions—adds complexity to natural language processing requirements.

Data protection emerged as another critical topic. Swiss data privacy laws are among the strictest in Europe, and healthcare providers expressed the need for absolute assurance that patient information would remain secure and locally hosted.

## Looking Forward

The SCS congress participation represents part of DocNote's broader strategy to establish itself within Switzerland's medical community before potential European expansion. The company has been making appearances at various Swiss medical conferences throughout 2025, building relationships with healthcare institutions and gathering feedback from different medical specialties.

Whether AI documentation tools like DocNote will achieve widespread adoption in Swiss surgery remains to be seen. The technology promises significant time savings, but surgical culture traditionally moves cautiously when adopting new tools that touch core clinical functions.

The conversations initiated at EPFL will likely continue as DocNote seeks to move from demonstrations to actual pilot implementations in Swiss surgical departments.
