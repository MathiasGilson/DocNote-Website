# Dr. Alice Gilson Speaks on AI in Surgery at ECC St. Gallen

In December 2025, Dr. Alice Gilson, co-founder and Managing Director of DocNote, was invited to speak at a prestigious medical conference in St. Gallen, Switzerland. Her presentation, "AI in Surgery: Inside and Outside the Operating Room," explored the expanding role of artificial intelligence across the full spectrum of surgical care.

## Beyond the Operating Room

While much attention in surgical AI focuses on robotic assistance and intraoperative navigation, Dr. Gilson's talk highlighted the equally important role of AI in the broader surgical workflow. Drawing on her experience as a surgical specialist at the University Hospital of Geneva (HUG), she addressed how AI can support surgeons throughout the entire patient care journey.

## Key Topics Addressed

### Preoperative Planning and Documentation
Dr. Gilson discussed how AI can streamline preoperative assessments, helping surgeons review complex patient histories more efficiently and ensure all necessary evaluations are completed before surgery.

### Intraoperative Applications
The presentation covered current and emerging AI applications in the operating room, from image recognition systems to real-time decision support tools, while emphasizing the continued primacy of surgeon judgment and expertise.

### Postoperative Care and Follow-up
Perhaps most relevant to DocNote's mission, Dr. Gilson highlighted how AI-powered documentation tools can help surgeons manage postoperative care more effectively, ensuring detailed operative notes are completed efficiently and follow-up appointments are thoroughly documented.

## Real-World Surgical Experience

What distinguished Dr. Gilson's presentation was her ability to speak not just as a technology entrepreneur but as a practicing surgeon who understands the daily realities of surgical practice. Her insights into workflow challenges, time pressures, and the critical importance of accurate documentation resonated strongly with the surgical audience.

## The DocNote Connection

Throughout her talk, Dr. Gilson drew on her experience developing DocNote as an example of how AI can be designed with deep input from practicing physicians. She emphasized that effective medical AI requires more than technical excellence—it demands genuine understanding of clinical workflows and physician needs.

## Audience Engagement

The presentation generated substantial discussion among attending surgeons and surgical residents. Questions ranged from technical implementation details to broader considerations about the evolving role of AI in surgical training and practice.

Several attendees noted particular interest in:
- Balancing AI assistance with surgical autonomy
- Training the next generation of surgeons in an AI-enhanced environment
- Managing the transition from traditional to AI-assisted documentation
- Ensuring AI tools enhance rather than interrupt surgical workflows

## A Surgeon's Perspective on Healthcare AI

Dr. Gilson concluded her presentation by emphasizing that AI should be viewed as a tool to enhance surgical practice, not replace surgical expertise. The goal of technologies like DocNote is to handle administrative tasks that take surgeons away from patient care, allowing them to focus on what they do best: providing excellent surgical care.

## Continuing the Conversation

The St. Gallen conference strengthened connections between DocNote and the surgical community. The discussions initiated during Dr. Gilson's presentation continue to inform DocNote's development, ensuring the platform remains closely aligned with the real needs of surgical practitioners.

We thank the conference organizers for providing this platform to discuss the important intersection of artificial intelligence and surgical practice, and we look forward to ongoing collaboration with the surgical community as AI continues to evolve in healthcare.
