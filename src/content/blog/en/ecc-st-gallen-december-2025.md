# Dr. Alice Gilson Speaks on AI in Surgery at Medical Conference in St. Gallen

**ST. GALLEN** — A medical conference in St. Gallen, Switzerland, featured a presentation in December 2025 exploring how artificial intelligence is reshaping surgical practice, not just in operating rooms but throughout the entire surgical care pathway. Dr. Alice Gilson, a surgical specialist and co-founder of DocNote, delivered the talk to an audience of surgeons and surgical residents.

The presentation offered a practitioner's perspective on AI in surgery—a viewpoint often missing from technology-focused discussions dominated by engineers and data scientists. Dr. Gilson's dual role as both surgeon and healthcare technology entrepreneur provided an unusual lens on where AI tools might genuinely improve surgical workflows versus where they risk creating more problems than they solve.

## Beyond Robotic Surgery

While robotic surgical systems like da Vinci have captured public imagination and substantial investment, Dr. Gilson's presentation focused on less glamorous but potentially more impactful AI applications in the perioperative period—the before and after surrounding surgery itself.

"The operating room represents maybe two hours of a patient's surgical journey," Dr. Gilson noted during her presentation. "But the documentation, planning, and follow-up work can consume four or five times that amount of surgeon time. That's where AI might create the most value."

This reframing resonated with several attending surgeons who expressed frustration with administrative burdens that extend well beyond the technical aspects of performing operations.

## The Documentation Bottleneck

A significant portion of the presentation addressed surgical documentation—operative notes, discharge summaries, and follow-up care instructions. Dr. Gilson described how detailed documentation requirements, while medically and legally necessary, often force surgeons to spend evenings and weekends completing paperwork.

The presentation naturally highlighted DocNote's approach to this problem, using AI transcription to capture surgical consultations and generate structured notes. However, Dr. Gilson also acknowledged limitations: AI tools currently work best for routine cases, while complex or unusual procedures still require substantial human intervention and editing.

"We're not replacing surgical judgment," she emphasized. "We're trying to eliminate the time surgeons spend typing what they've already said verbally."

## Audience Skepticism and Interest

The Q&A session revealed a mix of cautious interest and pointed skepticism from the surgical audience. Several surgeons questioned whether AI-generated notes would meet the detailed standards required for surgical documentation, particularly for complex procedures.

Others raised concerns about liability: if an AI system misses or misinterprets something a surgeon says, and that leads to poor patient outcomes, who bears responsibility?

Dr. Gilson's responses acknowledged these concerns directly, suggesting that current AI documentation tools should be viewed as assistants requiring physician review rather than autonomous systems. This framing appeared more realistic to attendees than claims of perfect accuracy.

## The Physician-Technologist Gap

What distinguished the presentation was Dr. Gilson's ability to speak credibly about both clinical medicine and technology development—a relatively rare combination. She described frustrations with non-physician-developed healthcare software that often reflects misunderstandings of clinical workflows.

"Engineers see inefficiencies and want to optimize them," she observed. "But sometimes what looks inefficient serves an important clinical purpose that isn't obvious from the outside."

This resonated particularly with older surgeons in the audience, many of whom have witnessed multiple waves of healthcare IT systems imposed by hospital administrators with varying degrees of clinical input.

## Business and Medicine

The presentation also highlighted tensions inherent in physician-founded healthcare technology companies. Dr. Gilson divides her time between clinical practice at the University Hospital of Geneva and building DocNote, raising questions about sustainability and competing priorities.

Some attendees questioned whether physicians can realistically manage both clinical practice and company building, or whether one inevitably suffers. Dr. Gilson acknowledged the challenges but argued that maintaining clinical practice keeps the company grounded in real physician needs.

## Market Position

For DocNote, Dr. Gilson's speaking engagement served multiple purposes: building brand awareness within Swiss surgical communities, gathering feedback on product development, and establishing thought leadership in AI-assisted medical documentation.

The Swiss medical market's relatively small size means that presentations at conferences like St. Gallen can reach significant portions of potential users. Several department heads from Swiss hospitals attended, representing possible future customers or pilot program partners.

## Broader Context

The St. Gallen presentation reflects growing medical community engagement with AI, moving from abstract discussions about future possibilities toward practical conversations about current implementation. Swiss surgeons, like their peers across Europe, are beginning to grapple with whether and how to incorporate AI tools into daily practice.

Dr. Gilson's message—that AI should augment rather than replace surgical expertise—aligned with what most surgeons want to hear. Whether this vision matches the reality of how AI will actually reshape surgical practice remains an open question that will likely take years to answer.

The presentation concluded with Dr. Gilson inviting interested surgeons to participate in pilot programs, though specific details about timing and participation requirements remained vague. For a relatively young company still establishing product-market fit, such exploratory conversations represent important steps toward potential broader adoption.
