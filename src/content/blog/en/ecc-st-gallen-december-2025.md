At the European Colorectal Congress in St. Gallen, Dr. Alice Gilson, visceral surgeon and CEO of DocNote, delivered a keynote address on how artificial intelligence is reshaping modern surgical practice, both inside and outside the operating room.

Inside the OR, she outlined four domains where AI already has tangible clinical impact: preoperative planning, intraoperative navigation, predictive monitoring and AI-integrated robotics. Advanced imaging algorithms now perform automated 3D reconstructions and anatomical segmentation, enabling surgeons to simulate procedures and personalise operative strategies. Intraoperatively, augmented navigation systems and real-time image analysis enhance precision and contribute to safer, more standardised surgery.

Beyond the OR, Dr. Gilson addressed AI's growing role in research and medical documentation. With surgeons dedicating a significant portion of their time to administrative tasks, AI-powered documentation tools offer measurable reductions in note-writing time, while raising important questions around data security and medical responsibility.

She concluded by emphasising that AI in surgery is no longer a distant innovation, but a present-day reality that must be integrated thoughtfully to improve precision, safety and time for patient care.
