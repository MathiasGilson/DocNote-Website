A recent study published in JAMA Network Open evaluated the impact of an ambient AI scribe on clinician documentation burden in a large academic health system. Over a 7-week pilot involving 46 outpatient clinicians across 17 specialties, researchers compared electronic health record (EHR) metrics before and during use of the tool.

<br>

The findings suggest measurable efficiency gains. Time spent writing notes per appointment decreased by approximately 15%, same-day visit closure rates increased, and after-hours "pajama time" in the EHR fell by nearly 17%. Clinicians also typed less, reflecting automation of documentation tasks.

<br>

Survey responses indicated reduced cognitive load and improved focus during patient encounters, with many clinicians reporting better engagement and less distraction. However, some participants noted that AI-generated notes still required editing for accuracy and style.

<br>

Overall, the study supports ambient AI scribes as a promising strategy to reduce documentation burden and improve workflow efficiency, while highlighting the need for continued refinement to optimize reliability and clinical integration.
