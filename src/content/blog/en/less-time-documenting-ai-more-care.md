Artificial intelligence is transforming medical practice, and scientific evidence continues to mount demonstrating its positive impact on healthcare professionals' daily work.

## Significant Reduction in Documentation Time

A recent study published in **JAMA Network Open** examined the use of AI-assisted ambient scribe tools in outpatient settings. The results are compelling:

- **20% reduction** in documentation time per consultation
- **Significant increase** in same-day chart completion rates
- **30% decrease** in administrative work performed outside clinical hours
- **Reduced cognitive burden** from administrative tasks for healthcare professionals

## Beyond Efficiency: Data Sovereignty

While documentation automation offers undeniable efficiency gains, a crucial question remains for Swiss healthcare professionals: **where is our data hosted?**

In Switzerland, health data protection is not just a legal obligation—it's a commitment to our patients. Foreign solutions, however performant, raise legitimate questions about:

- Data hosting outside Switzerland
- Potential secondary exploitation of medical information
- Compliance with the new Swiss Data Protection Act (nLPD)

## DocNote: A Solution Designed for Switzerland

**DocNote** stands out as a sovereign alternative, specifically designed for the Swiss context:

- **Exclusive Swiss hosting** of all data
- **No secondary exploitation** of medical information
- **Full compliance** with Swiss regulations (nLPD)
- **Design adapted** to Swiss healthcare system specifics (hospital and ambulatory settings)

Our approach isn't about adapting foreign technology, but designing a solution that meets the specific needs of Swiss healthcare professionals while preserving their patients' trust.

## The Future of Medical Documentation

Scientific data confirms it: AI significantly improves medical practice by freeing up time for what truly matters—patient care. But this transformation must occur while respecting our values and legal framework.

Technology in service of medicine, yes. Technology that compromises our patients' data protection, no.
