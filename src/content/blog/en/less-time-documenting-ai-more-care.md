As a physician, I believe we still underestimate the real impact of clinical documentation on our fatigue, working hours, and relationship with patients.

A recent study published in JAMA Network Open evaluated the impact of AI-based ambient scribe tools in outpatient practice. The results are clear and quantified.

The use of these tools is associated with:

- approximately 20% reduction in time spent on documentation per consultation
- significant increase in the rate of charts closed on the same day
- approximately 30% decrease in administrative work performed outside clinical hours
- and a clear reduction in cognitive burden related to administrative tasks.

Over the course of a clinical day, this represents real time savings, but more importantly, less work in the evening and better availability during consultations.

But one question remains central, particularly in Switzerland: where does the data go?

It is precisely to answer this requirement that we created DocNote.

DocNote is a 100% Swiss sovereign medical documentation assistance solution:

- Data hosted in Switzerland
- No secondary exploitation of data
- Strict compliance with the Swiss nFADP and institutional requirements
- Designed from the start for real clinical use, both hospital and outpatient

DocNote is not an opportunistic adaptation of foreign solutions. It is a solution designed in Switzerland, for the Swiss healthcare system, with a level of data protection compatible with the trust we owe to our patients.

The goal is simple: reduce the documentation burden without compromising medical quality or data security.

If you are a physician, department head, or institutional leader, and documentation and data sovereignty are concrete issues in your practice or establishment, I would be delighted to discuss with you and present DocNote, or discover our solution directly on our website: [www.docnote.ch](https://www.docnote.ch)
