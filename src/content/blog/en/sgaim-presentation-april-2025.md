# DocNote Presents at SSMIG Annual Conference

**SWITZERLAND** — The Swiss medical community witnessed a significant presentation on artificial intelligence in healthcare at the Swiss Society of General Internal Medicine (SSMIG/SGAIM) annual conference in April 2025. DocNote, a Swiss-based AI medical documentation platform, introduced its technology to an audience of general practitioners and internal medicine specialists from across the country.

The presentation came at a critical time for Swiss primary care, as physicians increasingly struggle with administrative workloads that detract from patient care. According to recent studies, general practitioners spend up to 40% of their working hours on documentation tasks, contributing to widespread concerns about physician burnout.

## Technology Meets Clinical Practice

The demonstration showcased DocNote's AI-powered transcription and summarization capabilities, designed specifically for medical consultations. The platform uses advanced natural language processing to convert doctor-patient conversations into structured medical notes, potentially reducing documentation time by up to 70%.

"The technology addresses a real pain point," noted one attending physician who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We're all looking for ways to spend less time on paperwork and more time with patients."

The presentation emphasized DocNote's compliance with Swiss data protection regulations, a crucial consideration for healthcare providers operating under strict privacy laws. The platform processes data locally within Switzerland and adheres to federal medical data protection standards.

## Reception from the Medical Community

More than 200 internal medicine specialists attended the conference, many of whom participated in discussions about the practical implementation of AI in primary care settings. Questions ranged from integration with existing electronic health record systems to the learning curve required for physicians to adopt the technology.

Several medical practices expressed interest in pilot programs, though many emphasized the need for thorough testing before widespread adoption. The Swiss medical community is known for its cautious approach to new technologies, prioritizing patient safety and data security.

## Broader Implications

The SSMIG presentation reflects a growing trend in European healthcare toward AI-assisted medical documentation. As health systems across the continent grapple with physician shortages and increasing patient loads, technology companies are positioning AI tools as potential solutions to improve efficiency without compromising care quality.

For DocNote, the conference represents an important step in establishing credibility within Switzerland's medical establishment. The Swiss healthcare market, while relatively small, is known for its high standards and could serve as a proving ground for expansion into other European markets.

The company's founders include practicing physicians, a factor that appeared to resonate with conference attendees who often express skepticism about healthcare technology developed without clinical input.
