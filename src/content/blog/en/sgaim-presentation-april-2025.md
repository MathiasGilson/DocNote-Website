# DocNote Presents at SSMIG Annual Conference

On the occasion of the annual congress of the Swiss Society of General Internal Medicine (SGAIM), we had the pleasure of presenting DocNote as part of the Lumière Prize, dedicated to innovative projects in medicine.

Our goal is simple: reduce the administrative burden on physicians while ensuring clear, reliable medical documentation that complies with clinical standards with a 100% Swiss solution. Designed and hosted in Switzerland in a closed loop.

A big thank you to Celi Julien and Majd Ramlawi for their trust and valuable feedback from the emergency department of Hôpital de la Tour, which helped evolve the tool closer to field needs.
