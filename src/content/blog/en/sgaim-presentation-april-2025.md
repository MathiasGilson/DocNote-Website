At the annual SSMIG Congress (Swiss Society of General Internal Medicine), one of Switzerland's leading medical gatherings, DocNote was presented as an innovative solution designed to reduce administrative burden in clinical practice.

As part of the congress program, the project was highlighted during the Prix Lumière, an award recognizing forward-thinking initiatives that aim to improve quality of care and physicians' working conditions. This distinction placed DocNote among a select group of projects addressing structural challenges in internal medicine.

The presentation emphasized both the measurable benefits of AI-assisted documentation, including reduced time spent on notes, improved report quality and improved relationship with the patient, and the importance of addressing limitations such as hallucinations, medico-legal responsibility and data protection.

DocNote's presence at SSMIG reflected a broader shift within Swiss internal medicine: a growing interest in AI tools that are not only technologically advanced, but clinically relevant, secure and seamlessly integrated into everyday workflows.
