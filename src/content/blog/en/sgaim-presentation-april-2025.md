# DocNote Presents at SSMIG Annual Conference

We are excited to announce that DocNote was presented at the Swiss Society of General Internal Medicine (SSMIG/SGAIM) annual conference in April 2025. This prestigious gathering brought together general practitioners and internal medicine specialists from across Switzerland to discuss the latest developments in primary care.

## Transforming Primary Care Documentation

During the presentation, we demonstrated how DocNote addresses one of the most significant challenges facing general practitioners today: the administrative burden of medical documentation. Our AI-powered platform was showcased as a practical solution that allows physicians to focus more on patient care while maintaining comprehensive and accurate medical records.

## Engaging with the Medical Community

The response from attending physicians was overwhelmingly positive. Many practitioners expressed interest in how DocNote could help them reclaim valuable time currently spent on documentation tasks. The interactive discussions highlighted the real-world challenges that our platform is designed to solve, from reducing burnout to improving work-life balance for healthcare professionals.

## Key Highlights

- Live demonstration of DocNote's AI transcription and summarization capabilities
- Discussion of security and data privacy features critical for Swiss healthcare
- Feedback session with general practitioners on feature development
- Networking with over 200 internal medicine specialists

## Looking Forward

The SSMIG presentation marks an important milestone in our mission to support Swiss healthcare professionals. The insights and feedback we received from general practitioners will help us continue to refine DocNote to better serve the needs of primary care physicians.

We thank the Swiss Society of General Internal Medicine for the opportunity to present at this important conference and look forward to ongoing collaboration with the general medicine community.
