A new qualitative study published in JAMA Network Open explored how frontline physicians perceive the use of ambient artificial intelligence (AI) scribes.

Researchers conducted semistructured interviews with **22 physicians** participating in a three-month pilot of an ambient AI scribe across primary care and ambulatory specialties within a health system in California. Interviews were guided by established implementation frameworks to assess usability, impact on workflow, and opportunities for improvement.

### **Positive impacts on workload and patient engagement**

Overall, physicians **reported favorable effects** on several fronts:

- **Reduced cognitive and temporal demand:** Many clinicians felt the tool eased the mental load and time pressure associated with documentation.
- **Improvements in work-life integration:** Several participants noted subjective benefits in balancing clinical duties and after-hours work.
- **Enhanced patient engagement:** A substantial proportion of comments suggested that clinicians could focus more on patients rather than taking notes.

These perceptions align with broader findings on ambient documentation tools showing potential to reduce administrative burden and support clinician well-being.

### **Barriers and areas for improvement**

Despite overall optimism, the study also identified several barriers:

- **Accuracy and editing needs:** Physicians frequently mentioned that AI-generated notes often required substantial editing, particularly around note style and length.
- **Workflow challenges:** Issues such as limited support for non-English consultations and device access were cited as practical obstacles to widespread adoption.

Clinicians offered concrete suggestions for enhancing tool functionality and usability, underscoring that user-centered refinement will be critical for long-term adoption.

### **A nuanced view of AI in documentation**

The study's findings suggest ambient AI scribes can meaningfully influence physicians' documentation experiences, potentially reducing burden while encouraging more patient-centered interactions. At the same time, clinicians emphasize the importance of improving accuracy, workflow integration, and inclusivity of these tools as they evolve.

As healthcare systems explore AI-based documentation solutions more broadly, qualitative insights such as these provide valuable perspective on real-world usability, challenges, and clinician priorities, complementary to quantitative research on time savings and efficiency.
