SOAP notes remain the gold standard for clinical documentation across medical specialties. Understanding how to write effective SOAP notes is essential for clear communication and quality patient care.

## Subjective (S)

This section captures the patient's perspective. Document chief complaints, history of present illness, and relevant patient statements. Use direct quotes when appropriate and note the duration, severity, and characteristics of symptoms.

## Objective (O)

Record measurable, observable data. Include vital signs, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and imaging reports. Be specific and avoid subjective interpretations in this section.

## Assessment (A)

Synthesize the subjective and objective information into clinical impressions. List diagnoses in order of priority, including differential diagnoses when applicable. Reference the supporting evidence for each assessment.

## Plan (P)

Detail the treatment approach, including medications, procedures, referrals, and follow-up instructions. Document patient education provided and any shared decision-making discussions.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Copying forward without updating
- Including irrelevant information
- Using ambiguous language
- Missing critical safety information
- Incomplete medication reconciliation

Modern AI tools can help streamline SOAP note creation while maintaining high documentation standards. These systems learn clinical workflows and can pre-populate sections based on the encounter, allowing physicians to review and refine rather than create from scratch.
